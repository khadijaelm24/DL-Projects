# Sentiment Analysis with BERT Project

## Overview
This project implements a sentiment analysis model using **Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)**. Leveraging the power of transformer-based architectures, this model classifies text data into positive or negative sentiment categories. This project explores the efficiency of BERT in understanding natural language context for sentiment classification.

## Features
- **Sentiment Classification Model**: Trains a BERT model to classify text data by sentiment (e.g., positive or negative).
- **Experiment with Hyperparameters**: Tests various configurations, including different learning rates and batch sizes, to optimize model performance.
- **Real-time Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance on validation data during training, allowing monitoring of accuracy and loss metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **PyTorch**: Framework used to train and implement the BERT model.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Handles numerical operations and data processing.

## Setup
- Python 3.7 or above
- PyTorch (version 1.x)

## How It Works
1. **Data Preparation**: Loads and preprocesses text data, converting it into token sequences suitable for BERT.
2. **Model Architecture**: Loads a pre-trained BERT model and fine-tunes it on labeled text data for sentiment classification.
3. **Training and Evaluation**: Trains the model on training data, regularly validating it on test data to assess performance.
4. **Sentiment Prediction**: After training, the model predicts sentiment on new text inputs, identifying them as positive or negative based on learned patterns.
